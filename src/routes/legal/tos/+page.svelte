  license to your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that Alchemy's license
  shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the

  of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so that Alchemy can
  prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize Alchemy
  to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your content taken
  from the Service by other members or third parties. Our license to your
  Content is subject to your rights under applicable law and is for the limited

<p>
  When communicating with Alchemy's staff members, you agree to be respectful

<p>
  In consideration for Alchemy allowing you to use the Service, you agree that
  Alchemy, Alchemy's affiliates, and Alchemy's third-party partners may place

  information and Content if required do to so by law or to enforce the
  Agreement, excluding any information pertaining to an individual, or
  individuals, belonging to protected group(s) unless that information is

<h2>9. Other Members' Consent.</h2>
<p>
  Although Alchemy reserves the right to review and remove Content that violates
  this Agreement, such Content is sole responsibility of the member who posts
  it, and Alchemy cannot guarantee that all Content will comply with this
  Agreement. If you see Content on the Service that violates this Agreement,
  please report it within the Service or contact Alchemy by email at <a
    href="mailto:contact@usealchemy.app">contact@usealchemy.app</a

</p>

<h2>10. Purchases.</h2>
<p>
  Alchemy may offer in-app purchases through the App Store, Google Play Store,
  or other payment platforms authorized by Alchemy. If you choose to make an
  in-app purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the
  applicable payment provider, and your method of payment will be charged for
  the in-app purchase at the prices displayed to you for the service(s) you've
  selected as well as any applicable taxes or fees that may be imposed on your
  payments, and you authorize Alchemy (or the third-party account, as
  applicable) to charge you.
</p>
<h3>Auto-Renewal and Automatic Card Payments.</h3>
<p>
  If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in-app
  purchase, your Payment Method will continue to be billed for the subscription
  until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, your
  subscription will automatically continue for an indefinite period of time, at
  the price you agreed to when subscribing, unless you cancel your subscription
  before the renewal date. Your card payment information will be stored and
  subsequently used for the automatic card payments in accordance with the
  Agreement.
</p>
<p>
  Objections to a payment already made should be directed to the relevant
  third-party account (such as the App Store or Google Play Store). You are also
  able to object by contacting your bank or payment provider, who can provide
  further information on your rights as well as applicable time limits. You may
  unconditionally withdraw your consent to automatic card payments at any time
  using the relevant third-party account.
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    If you want to terminate your subscription, the easiest way is to log in to
    your third-party account and follow the instructions to terminate or cancel
    your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with
    Alchemy or if you have deleted the Alchemy application from your device.
  </b>
  Deleting your account on Alchemy or deleting the Alchemy application from your
  device does not terminate or cancel your subscription. Alchemy will retain all
  funds charged to your Payment Method until you terminate or cancel your subscription
  on your third-party account. If you terminate or cancel your subscription, you
  may use your subscription until the end of your subscription term, and your subscription
  will not be renewed afer your term expires.
</p>
<h3>Virtual Items.</h3>
<p>
  You may be able to purchase or earn a limited, personal, non-transferrable,
  non-sublicensable, revocable license to use "virtual items", which could
  include virtual products or other units that are exchangeable within the
  Service for virtual products (collectively, "Virtual Items"). Any Virtual Item
  balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or
  reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent
  of your license. Virtual Items do not incur fees for non-use, however, the
  license granted to you in Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the
  terms of this Agreement when Alchemy ceases providing the Service or your
  account is otherwise closed or terminated. Alchemy, in its sole discretion,
  reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items
  and may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge. Alchemy may manage,
  regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time. Alchemy
  shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that Alchemy
  exercises any such rights. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through the
  Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE
  SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Virtual Items for use
  in the Service is a service that commences immediately upon the acceptance of
  your purchase of such Virtual Items. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALCHEMY IS NOT
  REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND IN RESPECT OF VIRTUAL ITEMS FOR ANY REASON, AND
  THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS
  WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.
</p>
<h3>Refunds.</h3>
<p>
  Generally, all charges for purchases are non-refundable, and there are no
  refunds or credits for partially used periods. Alchemy may make an exception
  if a refund for a subscription offering is requested within fourteen days of
  the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide
  for refunds.
</p>
<h3>Pricing.</h3>
<p>
  Pricing may vary due to a number of factors. Alchemy may offer promotional
  rates, which can vary based on region, length of subscription, or other
  factors. Alchemy may also test new features and payment options.
